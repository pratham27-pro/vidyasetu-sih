    which module_service.add_ncert_module() copies from when a school attaches
    this book to one of its classes.

    than as a fire-and-forget background task: this is a low-frequency,
    single-book admin action (not a hot user-facing path like quiz
    submission), so the simplicity of "the response only says success once
    ingestion actually happened" outweighs the extra latency of chunking one
    textbook's worth of text.
